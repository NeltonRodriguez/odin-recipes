            We are going to give you the best recipe
            to make a delicious pizza</em>
        </p>

    <h4>
        Ingredients for 16 servings:

        <ul>
            <li>½ cups warm water (600 mL)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>7 cups all-purpose flour (875 g), 
                plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, 
                plus more for greasing</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup semolina flour (30 g)</li>
        </ul>

    </h4>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            “Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling 
            the sugar  and yeast in the warm water. 
            Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles 
            form on the surface
        </li>

        <li>
            In a large bowl, combine the flour 
            and salt. Make a well in the middle and add 
            the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture. 
            Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough 
            begins to form.
        </li>

        <li>
            Once the flour is mostly hydrated, 
            turn the dough out onto a clean work surface 
            and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should 
            be soft, smooth, and bouncy. Form the dough 
            into a taut round.
        </li>

        <li> 
            Grease a clean, large bowl with olive 
            oil and place the dough inside, turning to 
            coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap. 
            Let rise for at least an hour, or up to 
            24 hours.
        </li>

        <li>
            Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a 
            lightly floured work surface. Knead for another 
            minute or so, then cut into 4 equal portions and 
            shape into rounds.
        </li>

        <li>
            Lightly flour the dough, then cover with a 
            kitchen towel and let rest for another 30 minutes 
            to an hour while you prepare the sauce and any other 
            ingredients.
        </li>


        <li>
            Preheat the oven as high as your oven will allow, 
            between 450-500˚F (230-260˚C). Place a pizza stone, 
            heavy baking sheet (turn upside down so the 
            surface is flat), or cast iron skillet in the 
            oven.
        </li>

        <li>
            Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce: Add the salt 
            to the can of tomatoes and puree with an 
            immersion blender, or transfer to a blender or 
            food processor, and puree until smooth.
        </li>

        <li>
            Once the dough has rested, take a portion and 
            start by poking the surface with your fingertips, 
            until bubbles form and do not deflate.
        </li>

        <li>
            Then, stretch and press the dough into a thin 
            round. Make it thinner than you think it should 
            be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up 
            during baking.
        </li>

        <li>
            Sprinkle semolina onto an upside down baking 
            sheet and place the stretched crust onto it. 
            Add the sauce and ingredients of your choice.
        </li>

        <li>
            Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone 
            or pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust 
            and cheese are golden brown.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add any garnish of your preference.
        </li>
    </ol>
